# PythonWebsite  by Table

Storage for the resources needed for the Python website to run, such as the HTML files (displays the HTML content) and CSS style sheets (alters the HTML content to make it look prettier).

### Not-So-Frequently-Since-I-Don't-Have-An-Audience-Or-Whatever Asked Questions:


**Where can I access the site?**
> https://htvr6t8r-32832.use2.devtunnels.ms/

**Why is the site down?**
> My personal computer has to be actively running the Python script for it to register your request, which isn't currently happening because:
> 1) I may be doing something else
> 2) I may have forgotten to run the script
> 3) I may not care to run the script anymore
> 4) I may be currently working on the script, meaning I don't have it running right now
> The only times the site can be expected to be up is when I announce it, otherwise, it is very much likely that it will NOT be working.

**Is this site malicious?**
> Sure, there's no way for you to know for CERTAIN, but I, myself, guarentee it's not. All the site does on the server-side is process your requests and deliver the correct HTML.

**Where is the Python script that hosts the website?**
> ... no.

**Why do you refuse to make the Python script public?**
> 1) People probably wouldn't believe the authenticity of it
> 2) The file contains a few pieces of sensitive data that I'm too lazy to redact

**Will the site be used for anything legitimate?**
> Good question.
> idk.
> This is all mostly for practice with networking, hosting a website, etc..
